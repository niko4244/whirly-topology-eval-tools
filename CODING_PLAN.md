## 1. Preparation

### 1.1 Checklist Review

- **Read and understand each item:**  
  Review all checklist items in detail. For any unclear requirements, document questions and reach out to stakeholders for clarification.
- **Identify dependencies and order:**  
  For each item, note prerequisites and which tasks depend on others. Build a dependency map or ordered list to guide implementation sequence.

### 1.2 Project Setup

- **Repository structure:**  
  - Ensure folders are organized:
    - `src/` for source code
    - `tests/` for unit, integration, and E2E tests
    - `docs/` for documentation
    - `scripts/` for automation utilities
    - `monitoring/` for health, metrics, and alert scripts
    - `feature_flags/` for toggles and rollout control
  - Add or update `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts, secrets, and environment files.

- **Checklist tracking:**  
  - Create a markdown checklist file (e.g., `CHECKLIST.md`) in the repo root.
  - Optionally, set up a project board (GitHub Projects or similar) for visual tracking.
  - For each item, add subtasks and status indicators in the checklist.
