- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
- **Structured error handling & event logging (ELK/Sentry ready)**
- **Notifications (email/SMS/in-app) for security events**
- **Data privacy (GDPR/CCPA), encryption, and anonymization**
- **Penetration testing & fail-safe mechanisms**

## Compliance Checklist
- [x] Encrypted data at rest and in transit (TLS, AES)
- [x] User consent and data removal flows (GDPR)
- [x] Audit trail for all security-critical events
- [x] Configurable notification and error messages

## Pen-testing & Fail-safe
- Automated vulnerability scanning (OWASP Top 10)
- Backup authentication methods and account recovery flows for high availability.
