# Self-Learning Software Development Pipeline

A robust, automated system for high-quality builds, leveraging test automation, machine learning, and CI/CD best practices.

---

## 1. Test Automation Framework

- **Unit Tests**:  
  - Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) with [pytest-mock](https://pytest-mock.readthedocs.io/) and [factory_boy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/) for mocking and test data.
- **Integration Tests**:  
  - Isolate and validate interactions between modules/services.
- **End-to-End Tests**:  
  - Use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for UI/UX flows.
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Maintain modular test suites (`tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`).
  - Enforce coverage thresholds (â‰¥90%).
  - Fast execution and parallelization (`pytest-xdist`).
- **Sample Structure**:
  ```
  /tests/
    /unit/
    /integration/
    /e2e/
  ```

## 2. Self-Learning & Training Capabilities

- **ML-Driven Test Failure Analysis**:
  - Collect historical test failure data.
  - Use scikit-learn or TensorFlow to classify and cluster failure types.
- **Test Parameter Tuning**:
  - Optimize flaky test parameters based on ML predictions.
  - Auto-adjust test retries, timeouts, and setup using feedback.
- **Continuous Improvement Loop**:
  - Retrain models as new data arrives.
  - Surface actionable insights (test code suggestions, flaky test identification).

---

## 3. Automated Build Pipeline

- **CI/CD Setup**:
  - Use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for build, test, and deploy.
  - Store artifacts and build logs for reproducibility.
- **Rollback Automation**:
  - Automated rollback on failed deploy (via workflow or script).
- **Sample Workflow**:
  ```
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
  ```

---

## 4. Documentation & Onboarding

- **Comprehensive Docs**:
  - [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) or [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for code/API documentation.
  - Interactive onboarding: [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) or dedicated sandbox apps.
- **Automation**:
  - Auto-generate docs from code/comments (docstrings).
  - Keep docs in sync with code via CI pipeline.
- **Sample**:
  ```
  /docs/
    /guides/
    /api/
    /tutorials/
  ```

---

## 5. Monitoring & Feedback

- **Build/Test Metrics**:
  - Use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for metrics.
  - Track flakiness, failure rates, deploy history.
- **Insights & Alerts**:
  - Automated reports to Slack/email.
  - Recommendations for unstable tests, failed builds.

## Sample Implementation Files

```
/tests/unit/test_sample.py
/tests/integration/test_api.py
/ml/test_failure_analyzer.py
/.github/workflows/ci.yml

## Scalable, Self-Improving Design

- Modular, containerized services (Docker/Kubernetes).
- ML feedback closes the loop for test optimization.
- Continuous documentation and onboarding improvement.
- Automated and observable from commit to deployment.
