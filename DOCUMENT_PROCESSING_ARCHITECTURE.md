# Scalable Document Processing Architecture

A robust, modular system to ingest, preprocess, parse, validate, and integrate documents of various formats with high reliability, accuracy, and scalability.

---

## 1. Document Ingestion

- **Supported Formats**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG, TIFF.
- **Validation**: 
  - Verify MIME type and file signature (magic bytes).
  - Enforce file size limits (configurable, e.g., â‰¤ 50MB).
  - Check for corruption and incomplete uploads.
- **API & Batch Support**: Accept files via REST, GraphQL, SFTP, or direct upload (UI).

---

## 2. Preprocessing

- **OCR**: 
  - Apply Tesseract or cloud OCR for images/scanned PDFs.
  - Auto-orient and deskew images, enhance contrast.
- **Text Extraction**:
  - Use libraries (pdfplumber, python-docx, textract) for structured text extraction.
- **Noise Removal**:
  - Filter out headers/footers, watermark artifacts.
  - Normalize whitespace, remove non-informative pages.

---

## 3. Parsing & Structuring

- **Field Extraction**:
  - Regex and ML-based key field recognition (headers, dates, IDs).
  - Table extraction (Camelot, Tabula for PDFs).
  - Hierarchy: Preserve section, paragraph, table structure.
- **Metadata Extraction**:
  - Extract document properties (author, title, creation date) via format-specific libraries.
- **Schema Mapping**:
  - Map parsed data to internal schema (JSON, ORM models).

---

## 4. Data Validation

- **Rules-Based Validation**:
  - Field format checks (date formats, numeric ranges, required fields).
  - Cross-field consistency.
- **ML-Based Validation** (optional):
  - Anomaly detection for outlier values.
  - Confidence scoring for OCR/text segments.
- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Flag low-confidence extractions for manual review.

---

## 5. Error Handling

- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Structured logging of all errors (file, extraction, parsing).
  - Automatic retries for transient failures (network, OCR).
  - Fallback: Route failed docs to quarantine/review queue.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Integrate with APM tools (Prometheus, Sentry).
  - Metrics: Throughput, error rate, latency.

---

## 6. Integration

- **APIs**:
  - Expose processed data via REST/GraphQL endpoints.
  - Webhooks for real-time downstream notifications.
- **Database**:
  - Store structured results in SQL/NoSQL DBs (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
  - Index by document ID, type, status.
- **Pipeline Compatibility**:
  - Modular interfaces for ETL, analytics, search, and archiving systems.

---

## 7. Scalability

- **Batch & Real-Time**:
  - Use task queues (Celery, RabbitMQ, Kafka) for parallel/batch processing.
  - Auto-scaling workers (Kubernetes, ECS).
- **Load Balancing**:
  - API gateway for balancing ingestion traffic.
  - Prioritize urgent documents in real-time pipeline.
- **Resource Optimization**:
  - Cache intermediate results, optimize memory usage.

---

## 8. Security

- **Encryption**:
  - TLS for all data in transit.
  - AES encryption for at-rest storage.
- **Access Controls**:
  - Role-based permissions for upload, processing, review.
  - Audit trails for all actions.
- **Compliance**:
  - GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific compliance as needed.
  - Data retention and redaction policies.

## Example Python Module Structure

```
/document_processing/
  ingestion.py           # File format checks, size validation
  preprocessing.py       # OCR, text extraction, noise removal
  parsing.py             # Key field, table, metadata extraction
  validation.py          # Rule-based and ML-based validation
  error_handling.py      # Logging, retry, fallback
  integration.py         # API/DB downstream connectors
  security.py            # Encryption, access control
  batch_worker.py        # Celery/Kafka batch logic
  config.py              # Centralized settings
  models.py              # Schema definitions
```

## Industry Best Practices

- Modular, stateless services for easy scaling.
- Standardized logging and metrics for observability.
- Pluggable pipelines for new document types or validation rules.
- Continuous integration and automated testing for reliability.
