# System-Wide Verification Checklist

## 1. Integration Testing

- [x] Run full regression suite  
  - All modules (S3 integration, backups, metrics, alerts, self-healing) have been tested together.
- [x] Validate cross-module interactions  
  - Backup failures successfully trigger alerts.
  - Unhealthy metrics prompt self-healing actions.

## 2. Manual QA

- [x] Simulate failure scenarios  
  - Service crash: Self-healing monitor restarted service as expected.
  - Backup error: Slack/webhook alerts triggered and logged.
  - Security incident: Alerts sent and logged.
- [x] Confirm system responses  
  - Alerts are sent to Slack/webhook.
  - Self-healing logic is triggered and restarts services.
  - Backups are retrievable from S3.
  - Metrics are visible and accurate in Prometheus/Grafana.

## 3. Documentation Review

- [x] All documentation in `docs/` is up to date.
- [x] Setup, usage, testing, troubleshooting are clearly described for each feature.
  - Each module has its own doc file.
  - README references all features and links to relevant docs.

## 4. Security & Compliance

- [x] AWS credentials and webhook URLs are stored securely (env vars, secrets manager, IAM roles).
- [x] S3 bucket versioning and retention policies are correctly configured.
- [x] Audit logs are available for service restarts and alert events.
