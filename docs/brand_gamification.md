# Gamification for Supported Brands

## Logic

- Badges and leaderboard updates are only awarded for Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, and Jenn-Air uploads.
- Uploads for other brands are ignored for gamification.

## Badges

- **Symbol Scout:** Uploads with 5+ unique symbols.
- **Schematic Uploader:** Uploads with at least 1 schematic or diagram.
- **Documentation Champion:** Uploads with 500+ characters of helpful text.

## Leaderboard

- Tracks only supported brand contributions.
- Shows upload count, earned badges, last upload timestamp.

## Example Workflow

1. Technician uploads Whirlpool tech sheet with multiple symbols and a schematic.
2. Badges awarded automatically if requirements met.
3. Leaderboard updated for technician.
4. Uploads for Samsung, LG, etc. are ignored for gamification.

## Extension

- Update badge logic or add new badges as needed.
- Change ALLOWED_BRANDS to fit business scope.
