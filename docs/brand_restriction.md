# Supported Brands

**Our platform exclusively supports the following appliance brands:**
- Whirlpool
- Maytag
- KitchenAid
- Jenn-Air

All internet crawling, tech sheet ingestion, knowledge base indexing, and search features are strictly limited to these brands. This ensures high relevance, accuracy, and compliance with your business focus.

**How it works:**
- Any documentation, schematic, or symbol extracted from the internet or user uploads is scanned for brand info.
- Only content matching the approved brands is added to the knowledge base and made available for diagnostics, simulation, and search.
- API and UI search results are filtered to show only supported brands.

## Example for Technicians

- Searching for “relay” will only return diagrams and documentation for Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, or Jenn-Air appliances.
- Uploads of Samsung or LG tech sheets will be rejected or ignored.
- Autonomous web ingestion only crawls official sites and resources for the four supported brands.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update brand filters if your service area changes.
- Maintain a curated list of official documentation sources for each brand.
