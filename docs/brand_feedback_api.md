## Endpoints

  - Submit a rating (1â€“5) and optional comment for a search result.
  - Feedback only accepted for Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, and Jenn-Air related queries.

  - Returns aggregated rating and comments for a given query (brand-filtered).

- `GET /search/trending?top_n=5`
  - Returns the top trending searched symbols/components for supported brands only.

## How It Works
