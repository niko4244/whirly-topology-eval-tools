# Smartest AI Circuit Analyzer - Architecture

## Overview
This project implements a modular, extensible platform for intelligent appliance analysis.

## Core Modules
- **ai/fault_diagnosis.py:** ML-based anomaly detection and root cause analysis.
- **ai/predictive_maintenance.py:** Failure prediction and maintenance scheduling.
- **simulation/digital_twin.py:** Real-time simulation and virtual modeling.
- **device/firmware_manager.py:** Adaptive firmware updates and security checks.
- **docs/auto_doc_gen.py:** Automated wiring diagrams and maintenance logs.
- **ui/voice_assistant.py:** Voice and conversational interface.
- **cloud/iot_gateway.py:** IoT and cloud data integration.
- **ai/energy_optimizer.py:** Energy usage optimization.
- **compliance/checker.py:** Safety code compliance and reporting.
- **security/monitor.py:** Security monitoring and lockdown.
- **api/openapi.py:** Open API for integrations and plugins.
- **ui/feedback.py:** User-centric feedback and gamification.

## Extensibility
- Each module is testable and independently upgradable.
- API endpoints support third-party plugins and external dashboards.

## Data Flow
1. **Sensor/Device Data**: Streamed via IoT Gateway to cloud.
2. **Diagnostics & Simulation**: Fault detection, predictive maintenance, and digital twin simulation process data.
3. **Compliance & Security**: Automated checks and lockdown features protect system integrity.
4. **User Interaction**: Feedback, voice interface, and gamification engage and inform users.
5. **Documentation**: Every event and change is logged and diagrammed for support and learning.
6. **Open API**: Connects external dashboards, apps, and plugins for extensibility.

## Example Workflow
- User requests troubleshooting by voice or UI.
- System runs diagnostics, consults digital twin, checks compliance, and produces annotated feedback.
- Results and recommendations are streamed to user, logged for history, and made available via API.

## Next Steps
- Implement logic in each stub.
- Integrate data pipelines and dashboards.
- Add ML, security, and compliance models as required.
