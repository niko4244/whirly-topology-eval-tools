## 2. Dependencies & Implementation Order

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. S3 Storage Integration (foundation for backups and artifact storage)
2. Automated Backups (depends on S3)
3. Prometheus Metrics (should monitor the above)
4. Webhook/Slack Alerts (relies on metrics and backup status)
5. Self-healing Service Monitor (final step, uses health checks and alerting)

/tests/
  /unit/
  /integration/
  /e2e/
/docs/
/scripts/               # Automation, backup, and maintenance scripts
/monitoring/            # Health checks, metrics, alerts, self-heal logic
/feature_flags/         # Feature toggles and rollout configs
