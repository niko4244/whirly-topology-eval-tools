# Final Review & Retrospective

## 1. System-Wide Verification

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Run full regression suite covering all modules: S3 integration, backups, metrics, alerts, and self-healing.
  - Validate cross-module interactions (e.g., backup failures trigger alerts, metric changes prompt self-heal).

- **Manual QA:**
  - Simulate failure scenarios (service crash, backup error, security incident).
  - Confirm alerts are sent, self-healing logic is triggered, backups are retrievable from S3, and metrics are visible.

- **Documentation Review:**
  - Ensure all docs (`docs/`) are up to date and clearly describe setup, usage, testing, and troubleshooting.

- **Security & Compliance:**
  - Confirm AWS credentials and webhook URLs are stored securely.
  - Bucket versioning and retention are correctly configured.
  - Audit logs for service restarts and alerts.

## 2. Checklist Completion

```
- [x] S3 Storage Integration
- [x] Automated Backups
- [x] Prometheus Metrics
- [x] Webhook/Slack Alerts
- [x] Self-healing Service Monitor
```

## 3. Retrospective

- **What Went Well:**
  - Modular structure: each feature isolated for easy maintenance and testing.
  - Automated tests for every feature accelerated QA.
  - Clear documentation and changelog for traceability.
  - Security and reliability considered at every step.

- **What Could Be Improved:**
  - Consider more integration/E2E tests for future features.
  - Automate deployment and monitoring setup (CI/CD pipeline).
  - Explore containerization for easier scaling and reproducibility.

- **Action Items:**
  - Schedule periodic reviews for backups, alert rules, and self-heal thresholds.
  - Plan onboarding documentation for new contributors.
  - Investigate cost optimization for S3 and alerting infrastructure.
